# To all challengers!
Very cool to take up this challenge for making an awesome product selector. Your task is simple yet extensive; use Vue to create the most awesome selector ever. Don't sweat the aesthetics to much but focus on clean code and the software design.

## The challenge (also software requirements)
Create a product selector that works for three different products from our catalogue.

* A menu to visit a product
* * A user should be able to go back to the home page
* A view where a user can configure a flyer, poster or businesscard.
* * Impossible configurations should be displayed.
* When the user is done configuring, the product configuration can be seen in a summary screen

## Getting started
Clone this repository. The only thing the repository contains is a JSON file with 3 products from our very own catalogue. You would first need to set-up [VueJS](https://vuejs.org/v2/guide/installation.html) in this repository.
